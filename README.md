## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop algorithms and tools for detecting debris in astronomical images. This can help in identifying and tracking space debris, which is crucial for space missions and satellite operations.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the debris detection algorithm, open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells in sequence. You can start the notebook server with the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Then, open `debris_detection.ipynb` and follow the instructions within the notebook.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for guidelines on how to contribute to this project.
